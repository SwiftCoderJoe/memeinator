                // Alright I know that sounds bad...
                // So basically I have no control over the label here. AFAICT I can't change the font size or basically anything else, which means that I can't limit the lines and force the picker to truncate. This would be fine, except that on DTS xxxL on an iPhone SE 3rd (which I hope to support, BTW), it creates two lines. So here we are. You could try fixing this again later if you want.
