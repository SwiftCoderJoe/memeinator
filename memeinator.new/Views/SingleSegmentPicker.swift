/**
 Experimental SwiftUI crap
 
 Basically the idea of this is a Picker that just cycles through options by clicking once. It's not really easily possible in the current state of SwiftUI, requiring the packages `GeorgeElsham/ViewExtractor` and `GeorgeElsham/TagExtractor`, so for now I've just given up. I'm leaving the code here in case I ever want to pick it up again, though.
